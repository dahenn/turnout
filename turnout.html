                <p>There is an incredible amount of media coverage on this subject. I'm not looking to add any specific 'hot take' with this post, or add any social commentary that may explain the motivations behind the result.
                    Instead, I aim to explore some of the data about this election that is not readily explorable elsewhere and provide some historical context for that data.</p>
                <p>In this post, I will explore the voter turnout of this election, with special focus on changes from 2012 and on the relationship between turnout and party margins.</p>
                <p>The main questions I want address are:
                    <ol>
                        <li>What happened with voter turnout and what were the consequences?</li>
                        <li>Is the theory that higher voter turnout is good for Democrats supported by this election?</li>
                        <li>Did new voting restriction laws affect the results?</li>

            <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
                <p>Voter turnout is calculated by dividing the number of people who actually voted (for a Presidential candidate, in this case) by the total number of eligible voters.
                The numerator was obtained from a continually updated spreadsheet from the <a href="http://cookpolitical.com/story/10174" target="_blank">Cook Political Report</a> and the denominator from the <a href="http://www.electproject.org/home/voter-turnout/voter-turnout-data" target="_blank">United States Elections Project</a>.</p>
                <p>Voter turnout is a good indicator of civic engagement and political enthusiasm. The United States has <a href='http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/08/02/u-s-voter-turnout-trails-most-developed-countries/' target='_blank'>trailed behind many other developed countries</a> in this metric.
                Some democracies, many in Latin America, have introduced <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compulsory_voting" target="_blank">compulsory voting</a>, which now see voter turnout rates in the 90% range. Other democracies also vote less frequently, which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/vote-less-to-vote-more/2015/06/10/12e0d014-0f82-11e5-adec-e82f8395c032_story.html?utm_term=.0dd1c73d1884" target="_blank">may explain lower voter turnout in the US</a>.</p>
                <p>Perhaps most worrying trend from this data is the horribly low turnout numbers in midterm elections, especially in 2014. Low turnout, in combination with the forces of gerrymandering, can create a representative government that does a very poor job of actually being representative of its people. You can read more about the effects of gerrymandering in <a href="http://danneh.co/gerrymander">my post on the subject</a>.

                <p>This chart is mean to show the relationship between who won a state (on the x-axis) and what the portion of that state turned out to vote (on the y-axis).
                    Each arrow represents one state, moving from the 2012 election to the 2016 election.
                The size of the arrow is determined by the number of electoral college votes the state holds.</p>
                <p>For example, CA (the largest arrow) moved up and to the left, meaning that it both moved to the left (i.e. higher Democratic margin of victory) and moved up in terms of voter turnout.

                <p>Given that voter turnout in 2016 was similar to turnout in 2008 and 2012 but delivered a very different final result, there must be some difference between the states where voter turnout <b>increased</b> versus where it <b>decreased</b>.</p>
                <p>In narrowing the above chart to "Increased Turnout" versus "Decreased Turnout", there's a general pattern that emerges. Voter turnout mostly increased in states that were comfortably on one side of the middle line (i.e. states that were solidly blue or solidly red).
                    On the other hand, states that had decreased turnout were very often near the middle line. Looking at the states that flipped from 2012 to 2016, 4 out of the 6 states had decreased turnout.</p>

            <div class='text col-lg-9 col-sm-12'>
                <p>Voter suppression has rightfully been an issue of increased concern since the 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County vs Holder.
                    This decision <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/07/07/how-has-voting-changed-since-shelby-county-v-holder/?utm_term=.b1066db2c7d7" target="_blank">
                    struck down Section 4</a> of the Voting Rights Act, which required Federal consent for changing election laws in areas that have histories of discrimination.
                    Since this change, a <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/voting-restrictions-first-time-2016" target="_blank">
                    series of new restrictive voter laws</a> have emerged that limit early voting, require ID at the time of voting, or create new obstacles to voting.</p>
                <p>Suppression of voters has also been occurring via the <a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/there-are-868-fewer-places-to-vote-in-2016-because-the-supreme-court-gutted-the-voting-rights-act/" target="_blank">
                    elimination of polling locations</a>, which have <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9169316/working%20papers/pettigrew-race%20gap%20in%20wait%20times.pdf" target="_blank">
                    disproportionately affected minority voters</a>. Minority voters have also been <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/03/federal_judge_slams_north_carolina_voter_purge.html" target="_blank">
                    targeted in North Carolina</a>, where Republican activists are able to target groups for elimination from voter rolls.</p>
                <p>So have these changes actually impacted voting to a significant extent? There is some evidence on both sides of the argument.
                    Many of these states that have recently implemented new laws have seen increases in voter turnout since 2012.
                    However, a few key states that decided the outcome of the election were also affected and saw decreased voter turnout; namely Wisconsin, Ohio and North Carolina.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Wisconsin</b> <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/analysis-new-wisconsin-voter-id-rules-expose-law-s-real-n639581" target="_blank">implemented a new law</a>
                         that requires a photo ID to vote. The law creates a new form of ID that is easy to obtain from the DMV, but that opponents just view as an additional impediment to voting.
                         This new requirement led to declines in voter turnout, such as <a href="http://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2016/11/10/milwaukee-elections-head-says-voter-id-law-hurt-citys-turnout/93607154/" target="_blank">those seen in Milwaukee</a>.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>Ohio</b> changed their early, absentee and provisional ballot rules. Republican lawmakers eliminated "Golden Week" - six days of early voting in which voters could register and cast a ballot on the same day.
                        Early voting was also reduced during weekday evenings and weekends in a 2014 Secretary of State directive, some of which was rolled back in 2015 after a legal challenge.
                        Provisional and absentee ballots were subject to invalidation if they did not fully conform to the information in the state's voter registration database.
                    </li>
                    <br />
                    <li><b>North Carolina,</b> as mentioned earlier, specifically targeted minority voters in their suppression efforts. Additionally, many election boards <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/north-carolina-early-voting/506963/" target="_blank">
                        limited early voting</a> and reduced the number and operating hours of polling places.

                <li>In a general sense, Clinton did not lose because of lower voter turnout. Overall, the voter turnout was slightly above 2012 numbers and in line with historical numbers.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Generally, secure states saw increases in voter turnout, while the majority of states that switched saw decreases in voter turnout. Therefore, in a more specific way, changes
                    in voter turnout did hurt Clinton and help Trump.</li>
                <br />
                <li>Voter suppression efforts may have played an important role in some key swing states. In any case, the growth of new efforts to make it harder to vote in a lot of different states
                    should be a matter of great concern to anyone interested in a well-functioning, fair democracy.</li>
                <br />
                <li>As a general rule, Democrats do better when voter turnout is high. Therefore, anyone eyeing 2018 as a chance for change in the legislature should take stock of the incredibly low turnout
                    rates in midterm elections. Mobilization towards voter turnout will likely be the only way to overcome the already stacked deck of Senate incumbency and the<a href="/gerrymander" target="_blank"> Republican advantage in gerrymandering</a>.
